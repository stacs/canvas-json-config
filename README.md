# Canvas JSON Config

A library that can be used to create the Canvas Developer Key JSON configuration.
This is done by using builders to create the Java objects which then can be turned into a String.
This String can either be sent directly to the admin to copy/paste or can be returned as part of a web endpoint.

See ConfigTest.java for examples of how to create the objects and turn them into a String.
